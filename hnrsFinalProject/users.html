                <h1>Users.</h1>
                <p>The key part to user-generated content. For my purposes, I am referring to users as those who do not profit from content creation. The median user, who may post pictures of friends or family, maybe art or gameplay clips, but doesn't use UGC as a means of profit.</p>
                <p>In general, this usage is the original intention of social media as a whole. The Facebook was meant to connect college students, not house viral fake news and prank videos. Users sharing and documenting their lives was the sunrise of this social media movement, and it continues to serve this purpose.</p>
                <p>To many people, social media is little more than a means to keep up with their loved ones who may be far. They share big announcements, like graduation or pregnancy. This more passive consumption of UGC isn't the problem, though. Users who can regulate their use aren't a part of the epidemic we're seeing recently.</p>
                <p>The problem arises from the increasingly addictive nature of the content on UGC content. Particularly short-form video content and sludge content. Problems like expressed by my boyfriend back in January, when he texted me</p>
                <div class="message">
                    <p>I think I am going to have to uninstall instagram, the reels are now showing me unhealthy relationships.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Endless scrolling to match a user's preference will inevitably lead to slight variations from a true match. If you have to keep supplying content endlessly, eventually you'll hit something with mismatched tags or run out of true matches and start showing less perfect matches. In many cases, it can take users down a path that is less favorable mentally. A user that is into fashion may start off enjoying outfit inspiration or tips videos, and end up watching more agressive content telling them what to never do or convincing them they  need to purchase an overpriced item to have style. This more extreme communication can make the user feel alienated and drastically warp their understanding of the people more physically close to them.</p>
                <p>Especially during & since the Covid-19 pandemic, when experience with the physical world was sparce, concepts of reality have been warped by what the algorithm shows.</p>
                <p>Since most only share their best moments on UGC platforms, this led to a host of issues with comparison. Only seeing others at their best sets false expectations for yourself when that just isn't a realistic display of the tactile world.</p>
                <p>This is well documented by Netflix's <i>The Social Dilemma</i>, which demonstrates the course a user can take from casual use of UGC to being convinced of radical political views.</p>
                <p>The addictive nature of the endless stimulants in UGC platforms is an investor's daydream and the nightmare of someone who seeks balance in life. It's hard to retrain yourself to enjoy other things without the constant stimulation of content from these platforms.</p>
                <p>Regulation is extremely slow in the tech world and even if it wasn't, UGC is notably complicated to enforce regulation on consistently. The only real way to break from this problem is to retrain ourselves to not need it, which is easier said than done. Apps use dark patterns to trick users into spending more time than they realize.</p>
                <p>Balance is the best thing you can do. You can't give up your main way to communicate with loved ones, but do your best to teach yourself to balance your life with and without content.</p>

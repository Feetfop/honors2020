                In her video, Mia reflects on what it was like choosing she wanted to be an influencer so young in her life. Her experience is fairly unique, as she is young enough to have grown up with UGC, unlike most large creators. She talks about being addicted to attention at a very young age, and how her development has changed because of this addiction. For a while in her life she put on her performance of “being 100% on,” which is something even many non-creators struggle with.

                Rhett and Link, an older creator duo and some of the original breakout creators on YouTube, talk about how their goal to be traditional creatives turned into running a content business. The two started as a sort of comedy/idea team and fumbled around with commercials for a while until hitting their stride with Good Mythical Morning, a show hosted on YouTube and shared on weekday mornings, which has amassed 18.2 million subscribers and 8.6 billion views in the 11 years since it’s beginning. Their experience starting at 0 and working to the entertainment monolith they are is a unique perspective of watching the world you’re in change rapidly and learning to work with the change instead of against it. Their podcast, Ear Biscuits, also has episodes of them discussing their separation from the Christian religion after being missionaries for said religion. The episodes, named “Rhett’s Spiritual Deconstruction” and “Link’s Spiritual Deconstruction,” (detailing their experiences separately) are riveting retellings of a separation from faith and now have yearly updates on their journey.

                In a discussion of his ever-sparce uploads and his lifelong struggle with depression, Daniel Howell details the struggle “between making content and being content.” Daniel is one half of the famous creator pair Dan and Phil (YouTube channels Daniel Howell and AmazingPhil), who blew up in the early to mid 2010s thanks to their alternative appearance and appeal to a certain community. This community, usually associated with the UGC platform Tumblr, is best characterized by their obsessiveness. Dan and Phil’s appeal to them was the concept that the two were gay and dating, when the pair only ever presented that they were friends and roommates. The constant prying and often vulgar comments, fanart, and fan-fiction from their community is a feature that has never truly gone away. This is of course, what Daniel refers to when he discusses “being content.” He recalls firsthand experiences of unhealthy parasocial relationships hurting him.

                QTCinderella (pronounced “Cutie Cinderella”), otherwise known as Blair, is a Twitch streamer who originally gained popularity for playing the popular video game League of Legends. Since then, she has grown thanks to running large events for other Twitch creators such as “Shitcamp” and The Streamer Awards. She is also the partner of another large YouTuber, Ludwig, who has 4.6 million subscribers and is an integral part of the Twitch community. In this interview with OG YouTube Creator Anthony Padilla, (one half of Smosh, the other being Ian Hecox), Blair covers the numbers struggles she has faced in the creator industry. She is someone who grew up in the Mormon culture, which gives her a unique perspective in the industry. Being a female gamer, (League of Legends is well known for housing an incredibly sexist community), Blair receives a lot of hate. She suffers PTSD from being “Swatted” by those wishing harm on her, an incredibly violent thing to experience that she recounts well in the interview and often on stream. She lives with dark thoughts due to many other factors of her life as well, and discusses her life with them.

            <p>Since the early days of creator payment programs, we have seen people misusing platform intentions & user attentions to grow a following and a career off of very little effort. Take <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sofloantonio/?hl=en">Soflo Antonio</a>, who went viral in the mid 2010s and amassed over 500 million subscribers between YouTube and Instagram. All he did to gain these followers was put short clips of his face in front of viral videos.</p>
            <p>Recently, with the growth in awareness of the wealth & fame you can get from being a creator on these sites, content like this is becoming more and more prevalent. TikTok has even implemented a feature like this, allowing a 5-second clip of another video to play, followed by your own input. A recent trend in content creation is similar, called "Sludge Content". Sludge content features a main piece of content, usually of someone talking, alongside colorful & stimulating gameplay or sensory videos. Sludge content works to keep viewers attentive by supplying them with the distraction. It's overtaken TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels. It's watchtime success overtakes each platform's recommendation algorithms and sticks users in a somewhat endless scroll of similar content.</p>
            <p>Sludge content buries more genuine creators who share their passions and talents under low-effort, widely disliked stimulation streams. The saturation of overstimulating Family Guy clips & Subway Surfers gameplay drowns out those trying to profit off of skills and passions.</p>
            <p class="footertext">Videos shown in opening only represent a segment of the creator community due to the nature of being vulnerable with their audience. Be mindful when applying their experience to the community as a whole.</p>

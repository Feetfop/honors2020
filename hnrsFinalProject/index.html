                <p>When people think about UGC, it's usually because they want to be big UGC creators. It's becoming a popular goal caareer, and represents a main reason UGC took off in the first place.</p>
                <p><b>2003,</b> google introduced the "adsense" program, allowing ads to be placed on content to make the content creators money. It was originally meant for sites, like blogs, but soon it integrated with video-sharing platform <a href="www.youtube.com">YouTube.com</a>, allowing creators on the up-and-coming site to make money for their work. Ads were placed in their videos and members of the <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/72851?hl=en">YouTube Partner Program</a> got a cut of the revenue. This encouraged bigger, more creative ideas from full-time creators.</p>
                <p>Slowly but surely, other platforms have picked up this concept. TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat all have systems to pay users for creating content on their platform. Others, like Tumblr, Pinterest, and Twitter are used to boost fame and translate an audience to the more profitable apps.</p>
                <p>Platforms like this have been popular pretty much since the internet's conception, but a recent event skyrocketed their importance.</p>
                <p><b>2020,</b> first-world countries experience lockdowns and stay-at-home orders thanks to the coronavirus pandemic. With more time on their hands than they knew what to do with, a record high number of people turned to UGC platforms to keep themselve busy. The mania hasn't truly died down in the 3 years since.</p>
